# Sublime Task Timer

A plug-in created for Sublime Text to time simple tasks such as how long
it takes to fix a given bug.

This plug-in gives you the ability to start, pause, stop and check the status
of a timer. When you pause, stop or check the status of a timer the elapsed
time is displayed as hours, minutes and seconds in the status bar.
